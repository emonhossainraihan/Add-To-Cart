## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

This will run `npm run watch` and `yarn start` concurrently including changing directory commands and `npm install` for installing their dependencies.

In the backend directory, you can run:

### `npm run watch`

Runs the node server in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected

In the frontend directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3006](http://localhost:3006) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Additional infomation

For backend I didn't use any database which give me to explore some cool features of NodeJS. Instead of saving my data in any database I save them into JSON file
which help me to play with JSON and `fs` module. Because I didn't include any user authentication system that's why I inter-related products and orders. In future I will try to add user authenticated system.

> I tried to use minimal information (using only `productId`) to retrieve product infomation to render orders which will reduce the complexity of query and less data to store.
